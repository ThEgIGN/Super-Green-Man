  Small platformer made in Unity following a great tutorial by Zigurous [(Check the playlist here)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqlFiJjSZ2x1mrMpSQgYdRm8PyWRTg6He).
The basic premise was made with the help of the tutorial and then expanded upon with my own ideas.

  All textures, art, fonts, sounds and music were made by the phenomenal people over on [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org/).

  Super Green Man is a platformer based on the Super Mario Bros game. The goal of the game is to collect as many coins as possible and destroy as many enemies as possible.

  Feel free to download the source code and build the game in Unity for yourself, or you can download my build from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hyZuSCCkg8g5-EHPYb0etR9Ut3kXQGtE/view?usp=drive_link).

  Below are the demos of three levels that show off different enemies and blocks. Enjoy!
